## Project Overview
**SportsHub** is a web‑based sports facility booking and management system built with Laravel. It allows students to browse facilities, check real‑time availability, make bookings, cancel bookings, and leave reviews.  
Administrators have a dedicated panel to manage facilities (add, edit, delete) and view system statistics.

---

## Project Objectives
1. To develop a convenient online system for booking sports facilities.  
2. To provide real‑time availability checking and booking management.  
3. To implement different user roles (student / admin) with proper access control.  
4. To create an attractive, responsive, and easy‑to‑use interface.  
5. To apply Laravel best practices in developing a functional web application.

---

## Target Users
- **Students** – browse facilities, book time slots, cancel bookings, leave reviews.  
- **Administrators** – manage facilities (add, edit, delete), view dashboard statistics.

---

## Features and Functionalities

### Student Features
- **User Authentication** – register, login, logout (Laravel Breeze).  
- **Browse Facilities** – view all facilities with images, sport type, location, price, and average rating.  
- **Search & Filter** – filter by sport type (Futsal, Badminton, Basketball) and location.  
- **Real‑time Availability** – system prevents double‑booking by checking overlapping time slots.  
- **Make a Booking** – select date, start time, end time → instant confirmation.  
- **My Bookings** – view upcoming and past bookings, cancel confirmed bookings.  
- **Reviews & Ratings** – after using a facility, students can give a star rating and write a comment.

### Admin Features
- **Admin Dashboard** – shows total users, facilities, bookings, and reviews.  
- **Facility Management** – full CRUD (add, edit, delete facilities) via a dedicated panel.

---

## Technical Implementation
- **Backend Framework:** Laravel 12.x  
- **Frontend:** Blade Templates with Tailwind CSS (inline style overrides for guaranteed button visibility)  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Authentication:** Laravel Breeze  
- **Development Environment:** XAMPP + Git Bash / VS Code

## Database Design

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
<img width="722" height="742" alt="Screenshot 2026-06-14 210024" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec75c362-4d77-47a9-9cf2-6773536d7fa3" />


The ERD shows the following relationships:  
- `users` → `bookings` (one‑to‑many)  
- `users` → `reviews` (one‑to‑many)  
- `facilities` → `bookings` (one‑to‑many)  
- `facilities` → `reviews` (one‑to‑many)  
- `bookings` → `reviews` (one‑to‑one)

### Main Tables

#### `users`
Stores student and admin accounts with a `role` column (`student` or `admin`).

#### `facilities`
Stores facility details: name, description, sport type, location, price per hour, image URL.

#### `bookings`
Stores bookings: which user, which facility, date, start time, end time, status, total price.

#### `reviews`
Stores reviews: rating (1‑5), comment, linked to a user, facility, and booking.

## Laravel Components Implementation

### Routes (`routes/web.php`)
Key routes:

```php
// Public facility browsing
Route::get('/facilities', [FacilityController::class, 'index'])->name('facilities.index');
Route::get('/facilities/{facility}', [FacilityController::class, 'show'])->name('facilities.show');

// Student routes (authenticated)
Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
    Route::post('/facilities/{facility}/book', [BookingController::class, 'store'])->name('bookings.store');
    Route::get('/my-bookings', [BookingController::class, 'myBookings'])->name('my-bookings');
    Route::patch('/bookings/{booking}/cancel', [BookingController::class, 'cancel'])->name('bookings.cancel');
    Route::post('/bookings/{booking}/review', [ReviewController::class, 'store'])->name('reviews.store');
});

// Admin routes
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin'])->prefix('admin')->name('admin.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [AdminDashboardController::class, 'index'])->name('dashboard');
    Route::resource('facilities', AdminFacilityController::class);
});
```

### Controllers
- **`FacilityController`** – lists facilities with search/filter, shows a single facility with booking form.  
- **`BookingController`** – handles booking creation (with availability check), listing user bookings, and cancellation.  
- **`ReviewController`** – saves reviews after a booking.  
- **`Admin/DashboardController`** – returns statistics for the admin dashboard.  
- **`Admin/FacilityController`** – full CRUD for facilities (create, read, update, delete).

### Models and Relationships

**User model** – has many bookings and reviews.  
**Facility model** – has many bookings, many reviews, and an `avgRating()` method.  
**Booking model** – belongs to a user and a facility; has one review.  
**Review model** – belongs to a user, facility, and booking.

### Middleware – `AdminMiddleware`
Checks if the logged‑in user has `role = admin`. Protects all admin routes.

### Views (Blade Templates)
Key views:
- `facilities/index.blade.php` – facility grid with search/filter.  
- `facilities/show.blade.php` – facility details and booking form.  
- `bookings/my-bookings.blade.php` – user’s bookings with cancel and review forms.  
- `admin/dashboard.blade.php` – statistics and **Manage Facilities** button.  
- `admin/facilities/index.blade.php` – list of facilities with edit/delete and **+ Add Facility**.  
- `admin/facilities/create.blade.php` – form to add a new facility.  
- `admin/facilities/edit.blade.php` – form to edit a facility.  

---

## User Authentication System
- **Registration & Login** – Laravel Breeze (email + password).  
- **Role Assignment** – new users default to `student`. Admin account is created via seeder or tinker.  
- **Access Control** – admin routes are protected by `AdminMiddleware`.

### Demo Credentials
- **Student** – register a new account (any email/password).  
- **Admin** – login with:  
  Email: `admin@sportshub.com`  
  Password: `password`

- Node.js & NPM  
- MySQL (via XAMPP)  
- Git

### Step‑by‑Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/almxnas/SportsHub.git
   cd SportsHub
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install NPM dependencies and build assets**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Environment configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and set your database credentials:
   ```ini
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=sports_hub
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=
   ```

5. **Generate application key**:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Run database migrations and seeders**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```
   This creates tables and inserts sample facilities.

7. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Functionality Testing 
- [x] User registration, login, logout.  
- [x] Student can browse facilities, filter by sport type/location.  
- [x] Facility detail page shows correct info and booking form.  
- [x] Booking – availability check prevents double‑booking; total price calculated.  
- [x] My Bookings – displays bookings with cancel option.  
- [x] Cancel booking – status updates to “cancelled”.  
- [x] Add review – rating and comment saved, shown on facility page.  
- [x] Admin login – sees Admin Panel link.  
- [x] Admin Dashboard – shows total users, facilities, bookings, reviews.  
- [x] Manage Facilities – add, edit, delete facilities.  
- [x] All buttons visible and functional 


## Challenges Faced and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| White / invisible buttons (Tailwind CSS overrides) | Used inline `style` attributes for critical buttons. |
| Missing migration columns (`user_id` in bookings, `comment` in reviews) | Added columns manually via `php artisan tinker`. |
| 419 Page Expired (CSRF) | Ensured `@csrf` in forms; temporarily added booking route to `VerifyCsrfToken::$except` for demo. |
| Admin dashboard view not found | Moved `dashboard.blade.php` from `admin/facilities/` to `admin/`. |
| Negative total price | Fixed calculation using `abs()` and correct `diffInMinutes()/60`. |
| SQLite vs MySQL confusion | Switched from SQLite to MySQL and updated `.env`. |

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Image upload** – allow admins to upload images instead of using URLs.  
- **Time slot picker** – visual grid for easier selection.  
- **Email notifications** – send booking confirmations.  
- **Pagination** – for facilities list when many facilities exist.
